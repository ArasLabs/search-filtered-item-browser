# Searchable Filtered Item Browser

It is possible to add filters to a search dialog for an Item property, to limit the results available for users to select from. This project contains both a document originally written for 9.2.0 SP3 as well as sample code that was written for 11.0 SP12.

The method code included in the example imports demonstrate how to perform a search to retrieve all of the Admin Identities that have a corresponding user.
